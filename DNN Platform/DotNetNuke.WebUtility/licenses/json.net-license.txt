Description:

The Json.NET library makes working with JSON formatted data in .NET simple. Quickly read and write JSON using the JsonReader and JsonWriter or serialize your .NET objects with a single method call using the JsonSerializer. Json.NET's features include:

- Lightning fast JsonReader and JsonWriter
- The JsonSerializer for quickly converting your .NET objects to JSON and back again
- Json.NET can optionally produce well formatted, indented JSON for debugging or display
- Attributes like JsonIgnore and JsonProperty can be added to a class to customize how a class is serialized
- Ability to convert JSON to and from XML 



Instructions:

 1. Extract Newtonsoft.Json.dll and Newtonsoft.Json.xml from the archive's /bin directory into your own applications.
 2. Add a reference to Newtonsoft.Json.dll within Visual Studio.NET to your project.
