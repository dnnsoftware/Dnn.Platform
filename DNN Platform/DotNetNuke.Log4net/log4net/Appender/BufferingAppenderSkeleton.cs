	/// <summary>
	/// Abstract base class implementation of <see cref="IAppender"/> that 
	/// buffers events in a fixed size buffer.
	/// </summary>
	/// <remarks>
	/// <para>
	/// This base class should be used by appenders that need to buffer a 
	/// number of events before logging them. For example the <see cref="AdoNetAppender"/> 
	/// buffers events and then submits the entire contents of the buffer to 
	/// the underlying database in one go.
	/// </para>
	/// <para>
	/// Subclasses should override the <see cref="M:SendBuffer(LoggingEvent[])"/>
	/// method to deliver the buffered events.
	/// </para>
	/// <para>The BufferingAppenderSkeleton maintains a fixed size cyclic 
	/// buffer of events. The size of the buffer is set using 
	/// the <see cref="BufferSize"/> property.
	/// </para>
	/// <para>A <see cref="ITriggeringEventEvaluator"/> is used to inspect 
	/// each event as it arrives in the appender. If the <see cref="Evaluator"/> 
	/// triggers, then the current buffer is sent immediately 
	/// (see <see cref="M:SendBuffer(LoggingEvent[])"/>). Otherwise the event 
	/// is stored in the buffer. For example, an evaluator can be used to 
	/// deliver the events immediately when an ERROR event arrives.
	/// </para>
	/// <para>
	/// The buffering appender can be configured in a <see cref="Lossy"/> mode. 
	/// By default the appender is NOT lossy. When the buffer is full all 
	/// the buffered events are sent with <see cref="M:SendBuffer(LoggingEvent[])"/>.
	/// If the <see cref="Lossy"/> property is set to <c>true</c> then the 
	/// buffer will not be sent when it is full, and new events arriving 
	/// in the appender will overwrite the oldest event in the buffer. 
	/// In lossy mode the buffer will only be sent when the <see cref="Evaluator"/>
	/// triggers. This can be useful behavior when you need to know about 
	/// ERROR events but not about events with a lower level, configure an 
	/// evaluator that will trigger when an ERROR event arrives, the whole 
	/// buffer will be sent which gives a history of events leading up to
	/// the ERROR event.
