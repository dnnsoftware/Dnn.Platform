        <h1>Adding a New Page</h1>
        <p>How to add a new page to a site. This topic shows how to add a page with only the basic settings configured. Page Name is the only required field. If you accept all default settings the new page will be added to the menu to the right of the page you were located on at Step 1. Pages added using this tutorial are only visible to Administrators, allowing you to add content to the page before setting it as viewable by one or more user roles.</p>
        <p class="note">Note: If a maximum number of pages has been set for your site, the <strong>Add Page</strong> button is disabled when the maximum number of pages is reached. If this happens you will need to contact your Host to allow you to add more pages. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Default.SuperUser Only">SuperUsers can modify the maximum number of pages set for an individual site, <MadCap:xref href="../../Using the Control Panel/Host Console/Site Management/Editing Host Settings for a Site.html">See "Editing Host Settings for a Site"</MadCap:xref></MadCap:conditionalText></p>
