        <h1>About the Message Center</h1>
        <p>The Message Center enables registered users to send messages to and receive messages from other site members and Administrators. Users can view their messages from within their DNN site without having to go to an external email provider (Gmail, Yahoo, Hotmail, etc.). The Message Center forms part of the User Profile area that members can access by logging in and clicking on their Display Name. The Message Center can also be added to any site page as long as the correct module permissions are then configured.</p>
        <p class="tip">Tip: User messaging is an alternative to the synchronous Send Mail option on the Newsletters module.</p>
