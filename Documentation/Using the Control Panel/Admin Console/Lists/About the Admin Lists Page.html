<<<<<<< HEAD
        <p>The  Lists page (Admin &gt; Advanced Settings &gt; <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Icons/Lists_16X16_Standard.png" /> Lists) displays the that enables Administrators to maintain lists of information that can be identified by a key value and a data value. A related copy of the Lists module is also available on the Host &gt;&#160;Advanced Settings &gt; Lists page.</p>
        <p> The Admin List module can access entries from Host List module, but Host List cannot access Admin List. The Host List stores site-wide Lists, such as Country, State, Region. Administrators can add new entries to lists maintained on the Host List menu as well as create new lists.

</p>
        <p>The List module is based around Lists and Entries, which are in effect the same, but their usage defines their differences:
</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">A List is a collection of Entries that has a Key Identifier and a Data Portion.
</li>
            <li value="2">An Entry is an individual item of data that relates to a List and is made up of a Key Identifier and a Data Portion.  An example of this is the countries list used in DNN. The list is 'Countries' and the entries are the actual countries. E.g. Australia, England, Holland
</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Note:&#160;Each Entry can also be a list. An example of this is the regions list used in DNN. In this case the Country, which is an entry under the Countries List, can be its own list and have region entries associated with it.</p>
