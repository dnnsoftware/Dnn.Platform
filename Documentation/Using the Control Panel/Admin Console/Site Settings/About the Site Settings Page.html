        <h1>About the Site Settings Page</h1>
        
        <p>The Site Settings page (Admin &gt; Site Settings) enables Administrators to configure basic and advanced site settings including design, advertising, payment, DNN usability, and user registration settings, etc. Where two or more languages are enabled on a site, different site settings can be configured for each language as required.</p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Default.SuperUser Only"><b>Important.</b> The Site Settings page includes a number of Advanced Settings (section names  Site Aliases, SSL Settings, Messaging Settings, Host Settings and Client Resource Management) that are only visible to SuperUsers. These settings can also be accessed and managed under Host &gt; Site Management. These settings are documented under the Site Management section in this manual. <MadCap:xref href="../../Host Console/Site Management/About the Site Management Page.html">See "About the Site Management Page"</MadCap:xref></p>
