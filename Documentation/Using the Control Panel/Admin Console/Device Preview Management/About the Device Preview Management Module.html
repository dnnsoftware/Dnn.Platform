        <h1>About Device Preview Management</h1>
        <p>The  Device Preview Management  module allows Administrators and the Host to preview their mobile device site as it will appear on different mobile devices. The module comes with a pre-existing list of preview profiles for commonly used devices. It also has the ability to create new preview profiles using either a pre-configured list of common profiles or you can create a new profile from scratch. Existing profiles can also be modified or deleted.</p>
        <p> This module is pre-installed on the Admin &gt;  Advanced Settings &gt; <img alt="" src="../../../Resources/Images/Icons/DevicePreview_Standard_16X16.png" /> Device Preview Management  page and cannot be added to site pages.</p>
