        <h1>Installing DNN</h1>
        <p>Installing DNN is a one step process to create your new website. The installation will detect your current language and if it is either English, French, German, Spanish, Italian or Dutch, the installer will automatically display in your language. The default installation will create either a blank website or a website with helpful information on getting started and some sample content. If you are using Evoq Content or Evoq Content Enterprise, you can also choose a mobile website template. The default installation will install a WYSIWYG rich text editor for managing the content and files on your website. Each of the templates is available in English, French, German, Spanish, Italian and Dutch.</p>
        <p>
            Prerequisite. An SQL Server or SQL&#160;Server Express Database. Note: If you are using a Microsoft Azure  database, review the Installation Guide for set-up assistance.</p>
        <p class="note">Note: If you are installing your DNN database on SQL Azure, the connectivity from DNN application may be slower. This occurs because SQL Azure is a cloud service and the latency between the database and the application is increased. To avoid a timeout error during DNN installation, it is recommended that you manually increase the http timeout (System.Web.HttpException: Request timed out) in the Web.config file by adding an executionTimeout setting under httpRuntime prior to installation. Note: Keyword "executionTimeout" is case-sensitive. In the below configuration setting, a value of 900 indicates 15 minutes which is more than enough for any installation. It is recommended that you remove this setting once installation is complete.</p>

        <p>Your newly installed website will be displayed once the installation is completed and you will be logged in to the SuperUser Account. </p>
        <p><strong class="Warning">Important.</strong> The User account created during install is both a Host and Admin user.  This user only shows up under the Host SuperUser Accounts page.  No users will show up under Admin User Accounts.</p>
        <p><strong>Best Practice:</strong> The Host (SuperUser) account that is created during installation should be disabled after creating a new SuperUser account by going to Host &gt; SuperUsers. Everyone should do this always. This new SuperUser account will not be visible under Admin &gt; Users therefore no Admin will be able to alter the Host account.</p>
