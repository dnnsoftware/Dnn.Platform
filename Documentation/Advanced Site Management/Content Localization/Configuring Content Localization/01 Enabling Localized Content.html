        <h1>Enabling Localized Content</h1>
        <p>How to create a localized copy of the current site content for each of the enabled languages using the Languages module. This creates a translator role ( titled Translator and then appended with the country code. E.g. Translator (EN-AU) ) for each enabled language. This also enables the Localization tab under Page Settings for all site pages.  <MadCap:xref href="../../../Building Your Site/Adding and Managing Pages/Page Settings/Page Details Settings for Existing Pages.html">See "Page Details Settings for Existing Pages"</MadCap:xref></p>
        <p>
            <MadCap:snippetText src="../../../../../Resources/Snippets/Prerequisite.flsnp" />Localized content must be enabled by a SuperUser. Localized content cannot be disabled once it has been enabled. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Default.SuperUser Only"> <![CDATA[ ]]><MadCap:xref href="../../../Using the Control Panel/Host Console/Host Settings/Other Settings/Allowing-Disallowing Content Localization.html">See "Allowing/Disallowing Content Localization"</MadCap:xref></MadCap:conditionalText></p>

            <li>The Enable Localized Content message box is now displayed listing the Current Site Default language and informing you that this language cannot be changed once localized content is enabled.

            <li>At <b>Make all pages Translatable</b>, select from these options:<ol><li><MadCap:snippetText src="../../../../../Resources/Snippets/Check.flsnp" />if all pages that are in the default language will be made translatable.

            <li> A progress bars is now displayed that shows the languages and pages being created for each of the enabled languages. In this example all pages have been chosen as translatable so a copy of each page (including the modules and content on these pages) for each language is created. A translator role for each language is also created at this step. Once this step is complete, a new tab called "Content Localization" is available on the Languages module and a new section titled Content Localization is displayed in the culture grid with the following new fields:<ul start="2"><li value="2"><img alt="" src="../../../Resources/Images/Icons/Languages_16x16_Standard.png" /><b> No of Pages</b>: This displays the number of pages and the percentage of pages that have been localized. <br />Note: In the below image, because all pages were chosen from translation  the number of pages that were localized (e.g. 12) is the same for the default language of English (United States) and all other enabled languages and percentage of localized pages would be 100%.<br />If we had elected to choose the pages to be localized at a later step, then the number of pages would show as zero ( 0 ) for the default language of English (United States) as no pages had been localized as yet. For each of the other enabled languages, the <img alt="" src="../../../Resources/images/Icons/Languages_16x16_Standard.png" /><b> No of Pages</b> button is displayed as a link that you can click to create localized pages  for that language. Each enabled language displays this button, allowing you to choose different pages to localize for each language as required. <br /></li><li value="3"><img alt="" src="../../../Resources/Images/Icons/translated.gif" /><b> Translated Pages</b>: This displays the number of page  and the percentage of pages that have been translated.</li></ul><ul start="2"><li value="2"><b>Active</b>: Localized content is activated / not activated.</li><li value="3"><b>Publish</b>: The <b>Publish Pages</b><img alt="" src="../../../Resources/images/Icons/PublishLanguage_16x16_Standard.png" /> icon enables editors to publish pages that are marked as translated for this language.</li></ul></li>

        <p>To view the newly created localized copies for this language, click on the country flag for this language (typically located in the top right corner of the site above the menu). This displays the localized copies of these pages in the menu. Note: Page names are appended with the country code. E.g. For Australia it is (EN-AU). You can modify these names as you like by editing the Page Name. <MadCap:xref href="../../../Building Your Site/Adding and Managing Pages/Page Settings/Page Details Settings for Existing Pages.html">See "Page Details Settings for Existing Pages"</MadCap:xref></p>

        <p>A translator role named Translator (en-AU) is now displayed in the Security Roles module for each language that is enabled. Before translation can begin, the users who are the translators for each language should be added to the newly created translator roles. <MadCap:xref href="../../../Using the Control Panel/Admin Console/Security Roles/Module Editors/Adding a User to a Security Role.html">See "Adding a User to a Security Role"</MadCap:xref> or <MadCap:xref href="../../../Using the Control Panel/Admin Console/User Accounts/Administrators/Adding A User to a Role.html">See "Adding A&#160;User to a Role"</MadCap:xref></p>
