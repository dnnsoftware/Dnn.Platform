        <h1>Troubleshooting: IFrame Redirects to Source Website</h1>
        <p>Sites can be programmed to prevent them from being framed with the IFrame module. If these sites are saved as the Source in an IFrame module, the site will not appear inside the IFrame module on the page. Instead, when a user clicks on the page containing this IFrame, they will be redirected to the framed website. To avoid to this problem, do not frame any sites without first seeking the permission of the site owner and confirming with their webmaster that the Source to be framed permits framing. If however, a Source URL is to be used without first confirming that the website can be framed, we suggest the following precautions:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Create a new page and test the source URL on this page. </li>
    <li>If the website does not permit framing, log in as the Administrator on the home page of the site. </li>
    <li>Navigate to Admin &gt; <img alt="" src="../../../../Resources/Images/Icons/Tabs_16X16_Standard.png" /> <b>Page Management</b>. </li>
    <li>Locate the test page and delete it.</li>
</ol>
