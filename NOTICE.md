## DNN Platform
DNN Platform utilizes components that were developed by third-party entities. Some of these are used directly from source code while others are referenced as libraries.

## Third Parry Source Code
DNN Platform is using a few third-party libraries as source code with some modification to run natively under the platform. These are:
- [Client Dependency](https://github.com/Shazwazza/ClientDependency) – used as *ClientDependency.Core* project.
- [Log4Net](http://logging.apache.org/log4net/download_log4net.cgi) – used as *DotNetNuke.Log4Net* project.

## Third Parry Libraries
All libraries used in DNN Platform have their licenses in the [Licenses folder](https://github.com/dnnsoftware/Dnn.Platform/tree/development/Website/Licenses).
