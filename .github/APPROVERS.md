# The Approvers Group

A vital role in our project is reserved for the people who decide what code is accepted into our framework, and what
is not. This is the task of the (Git) Approvers Group. To explain let's look at how the code of DNN gets changed.

As you are probably aware the way the source code of DNN (which is hosted on Github)
is currently managed, is through accepting so-called Pull Requests (or PRs). These PRs are submitted by
enthusiasts like you and me where we aim to change the Repository ("base code") of the platform. The current list
of PRs can be found here: [https://github.com/dnnsoftware/Dnn.Platform/pulls](https://github.com/dnnsoftware/Dnn.Platform/pulls)

Before any PR gets accepted it has to be reviewed by 2 people before it can be "merged" into the main repository.
This reviewing and merging is done by a handful of people.
Due to the sensitive nature of this task and the skills required to do it, this is a highly restricted group.
In the interest of transparency and to avoid any confusion here is a list of criteria that guide our decision as to who is part of this group:

- Actively take part in the project (like attending Tech meetings, contributing code, etc)
- Having in-depth knowledge of the overall organization and architecture of the project (this favors people who have been with the project for some time)
- Having a track record of good code contributions
- Knowledge of Git and Github
- Having enough time to devote to this task

This group is dynamic. Meaning: we expect people to float into and out of this group.
It is not an award that you put on a shelf like an MVP-ship.
It is an ongoing task and if someone drifts away to focus on something else that person will be removed from this group.

This group is practical. Meaning: there are no stacks of procedures.
We try to keep things simple and focus on a smooth development process for DNN.
Members stay in touch through a Slack channel and meet
bi-weekly to discuss progress.

The current members are:

- Brian Dukes
- Peter Donker
- Mitch Sellers
- David Poindexter
- Daniel Valadas
- Matt Rutledge
