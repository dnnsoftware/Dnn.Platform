  We have detected this issue has not had any activity during the last 90 
  days. That could mean this issue is no longer relevant and/or nobody has 
  found the necessary time to address the issue. We are trying to keep the 
  list of open issues limited to those issues that are relevant to the 
  majority and to close the ones that have become 'stale' (inactive). If no 
  further activity is detected within the next 14 days, the issue will be 
  closed automatically.

  If new comments are are posted and/or a solution (pull request) is 
  submitted for review that references this issue, the issue will not be 
  closed. Closed issues can be reopened at any time in the future. Please
  remember those participating in this open source project are volunteers 
  trying to help others and creating a better DNN Platform for all. Thank 
  you for your continued involvement and contributions!
