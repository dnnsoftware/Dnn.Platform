# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We make every effort to ensure speedy analysis of reported issues and, where required, provide workarounds and updated application releases to fix them. If you see suspected issues/security scan results please report them via [the GitHub feature for reporting a security vulnerability](https://github.com/dnnsoftware/Dnn.Platform/security/advisories/new).

All submitted information is viewed only by members of the DNN Security Task Force, and will not be discussed outside the Task Force without the permission of the person/company who reported the issue. Each confirmed issue is assigned a severity level (critical, moderate, or low) corresponding to its potential impact on the security of DNN installations.

* **Critical** means the issue can be exploited by a remote attacker to gain access to DNN data or functionality. All critical issue security bulletins include a recommended workaround or fix that should be applied as soon as possible.
* **Moderate** means the issue can compromise data or functionality on a portal/website only if some other condition is met (e.g. a particular module or a user within a particular role is required). Moderate issue security bulletins typically include recommended actions to resolve the issue.
* **Low** means the issue is very difficult to exploit or has a limited potential impact.

Once an issue has been resolved via a public release of DNN Platform the release notes on GitHub are updated to reflect that security bulletins exist for the release.  Additionally the [DNN Community Security Center](https://dnncommunity.org/security) is updated with the vulnerability details.  We strongly suggest using the "Watch" option on GitHub for "Releases" at a minimum to receive notifications of updated DNN Platform Releases.

As a general policy, DNN Platform does not issue Hot Fix releases to prior versions of DNN Platform.  If a remediation is possible via configuration it shall be noted as applicable in the posted bulletins.
